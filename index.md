An eager graduate student looking for a PhD research oppurtunities. I am extremely interested in cellular phenotypic heterogeneity, metabolic plasticity and community dynamics. Always on the lookout for a scientific challenege. Feel free to change my mind on why biochemistry trumps particle physics any day. Bookmark this page for a quick recall! 

My core strengths are biochemistry and molecular biology. I am looking forward to expand my skills further, especially in statistics and programming. 

I enjoy a good cup of tea, playing Dungeons and Dragons, digital art, reading and complaining about why "Ignorance is not bliss". As an animal lover and plant afficianado, I  have a special fondness for the wildnerness.
