I'm an eager graduate student looking for a PhD research oppurtunities. I am extremely interesting in cellular phenotypic heterogeneity, metabolic plasticity and community dynamics. Feel free to change my mind on why biochemistry trumps particle physics any day. Bookmark this page for a quick recall! 

My core strengths are biochemistry and molecular biology. I am looking forward to expand my skills further and pick up new skills in statistics and programming. 

I like tea, Dungeons & Dragons, and grumbling about how ignorance is not bliss!
